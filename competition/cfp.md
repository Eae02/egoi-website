The EGOI Scientific Committee invites the competitive programming community to submit problems for EGOI 2023.

EGOI is a programming competition for girls in secondary education all across Europe, and the contest will take place on July 15-21 2023 in Lund, Sweden.

We are looking for problems of varying difficulties and types (batch, output-only or interactive).
To get an idea of style and difficulty, see the problems from the
previous two years (<a href="https://egoi.ch/en/tasks/">2021</a>,  <a href="https://ubilo.tubitak.gov.tr/egoi2022/tasks">2022</a>). The problems
should be original and should not have been seen by any potential EGOI 2023 contestants. The topics
and techniques used must conform to the <a href="https://people.ksp.sk/~misof/ioi-syllabus/">IOI syllabus</a>.

Minimum contents of submission:

* Author's contact details (name, affiliation, email).
* Problem statement in English.
* Description of subtasks along with their expected difficulty.
* Solution sketches.

It is recommended that the submission also contains:

* Solution(s) in C++, Python, or any major programming language.
* Test data (especially sample test cases), or descriptions of how to generate it.
* Any additional comments.

Attach all files for one problem in a single zip archive and submit it to Nils Gustafsson at [nils.gustafsson@kodsport.se](mailto:nils.gustafsson@kodsport.se).

We will be pleased to invite the authors of the selected problems to the contest. The authors are responsible for arranging their travel, but the costs for their stay will be covered.

The submission deadline is *January 31, 2023*.

Please direct additional questions to [nils.gustafsson@kodsport.se](mailto:nils.gustafsson@kodsport.se).
