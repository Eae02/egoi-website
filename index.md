Welcome to the website for European Girls' Olympiad in Informatics 2023! 

The European Girls' Olympiad in Informatics (EGOI) is a new programming competition just for girls. Inspired by the success of the European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad we want to create a similar competition in Informatics. The format of the competition will be similar to established competitions such as the International Olympiad in Informatics or the Central European Olympiad in Informatics.
