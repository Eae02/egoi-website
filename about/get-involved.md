This summer the EGOI, European Girlsâ€™ Olympiad in Informatics, is coming to Lund, Sweden! EGOI is an international competition for young women interested in Computer Science, lasting for one week. The goal is to provide a platform for young women to enjoy and deepen their interest in Computer Science. Apart from algorithmically challenging problems there will also be social activities where the participants get to hang out with each other.

Do you want to be a part of making this event a reality? Of course you want to! There are a number of ways to get involved, from being a guide who gets to experience every part of the event together with the participants, to being a volunteer taking photographs during the event, or being a conferencier speaking at ceremonies! As a volunteer or guide, you do not need to have any programming experience whatsoever.

For all guides and volunteers we will have a kick-off on the 14th of July. The actual event is July 15th to 21st.

Deadline for applications is March 31st 2023.
