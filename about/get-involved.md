This summer, EGOI (*European Girls' Olympiad in Informatics*) is coming to Lund, Sweden! EGOI is an international competition lasting for one week, aimed at young women interested in computer science. The goal is to provide a platform for young women to enjoy and deepen their interest in Computer Science. Apart from algorithmically challenging problems, there will also be social activities where the participants get to hang out with each other.


Would you like to be a part of making this event a reality? **Of course, you would!** There are several ways to get involved, from being a guide who experiences every part of the event together with the participants, to being a volunteer taking photographs or being a conferencier speaking at ceremonies! As a volunteer or guide, you do not need to have any programming experience whatsoever.

We will have a kick-off for all guides and volunteers on the 14th of July. The actual event is from July 15th to 21st.

Apply via [**this form**](https://forms.gle/UrR3oFQwcdoS1ZHg8).
